Description: This R toolkit enables automated clinical data analysis. It characterizes variables as continuous or categorical, providing descriptive statistics (mean/SD, medians/ranges, frequencies). Survival analysis computes median survival with confidence intervals, survival rates at specific timepoints, and supports subgroup comparisons including hazard ratios (HRs) and log-rank p-values. Therapy response metrics (e.g., ORR/DCR) are reported with exact confidence intervals. Association tests automatically select chi-square or Fisher's exact methods based on data characteristics. Longitudinal group comparisons integrate statistical testing (t-test or Wilcoxon selected via normality/variance checks) with visualization, generating publication-ready plots annotated with key results. The system features intelligent method selection, dynamic p-value formatting, medical outcome tracking (OS/PFS/ORR), and consolidated reporting for clinical research.
